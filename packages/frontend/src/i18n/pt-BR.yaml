        How RCV is counted: Ballots are counted in elimination rounds. In each round, your vote goes to the candidate you ranked highest, 
        if possible. If no candidate has a majority of remaining votes the candidate with the fewest votes is eliminated. 
        If your vote is unable to transfer, it will not be counted in later rounds. If a candidate has a majority of remaining votes 
        in a round, they are elected.

    score_higher_than_runoff_title: Why is the top scoring candidate different from the winner?
    score_higher_than_runoff_text: |
      The top-scoring candidate often matches the runoff winner, but not always. 
      In the runoff, only the most preferred votes count, which can shift the outcome. 
      For example, a 5 vs. 4-star vote has less impact in scoring but counts fully in the runoff, 
      while a 5 vs. 0-star vote makes a big difference in scoring but is equal in the runoff. 
      The runoff winner comes out on top because more voters prefer them over the runner-up.
    # Alternate Text:
    # The top-scoring candidate usually matches the winner in the runoff, but not always. 
    # The runoff round counts only the votes for the candidate a voter most prefers, which can lead to different weightings than in the scoring round. 
    # For example, a slight preference (like 5 vs. 4 stars) has a small impact in scoring but counts as one full vote in the runoff. 
    # Conversely, a strong preference (like 5 vs. 0 stars) makes a big difference in scoring but carries the same weight in the runoff. 
    # Ultimately, the runoff winner becomes the final winner because they are preferred by more voters over the runner-up.
