    well as multi-winner proportional methods such as STAR-PR.


    It's also flexible to fit your voting scenario, whether it's a massive
    public poll, a high stakes board election, or just a casual poll
    picking a restaurant
    dev.star.vote can fit your needs and provide a secure, auditable election
